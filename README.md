# Locating Tibetan Monasteries

This task of aggregating and verifying the GPS location is undertaken by two Studio Nyandak team members working full-time for the past year or so.

The total number of sites from BDRC dataset was 2,650 and there are 1,510 sites outside Kham. We managed to complete the verification of about 80% (excluding Kham).  

Additionally, we are working on a database of monasteries outside of Tibet that were either built before 1959 or after 1959 by exiled Tibetans. This covers India, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia and the west. We will share the spreadsheet tomorrow. 

Please let us know your thoughts and feedback. We really appreciate your collaboration and support. 

The data is organized into the broad category of inside Tibet, outside Tibet before 1959 and outside Tibet after 1959.

The color coding used for monasteries inside Tibet is: Green is [Studio Nyandak](https://www.nyandak.com/), Yellow is [BDRC](https://www.bdrc.io/), Pink is [ToL](https://treasuryoflives.org/), and Blue is [Prof. Gray](http://ealac.columbia.edu/gray-tuttle/).
